✨ Hi! I'm Chiara, bioinformatician and PhD student at [zoo_e lab](https://evolinus.github.io/zooe/) at University of Pavia (Italy).

🦟 I'm currently working on transposable elements in mosquitoes to learn more about their potential role in the thermal adaptability of these creatures. To do so, I combine wet lab experiments with downstream bioinformatics analysis. My other research interests include eco-evo-devo, population genetics and evolutionary biology.

🐜 In case you want to contact me, feel free to send me an email at [chiara.albertini01@universitadipavia.it](mailto:chiara.albertini01@universitadipavia.it)!
