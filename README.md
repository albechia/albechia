✨ Hi! I'm Chiara, bioinformatician and PhD student at zoo_e lab at University of Pavia (Italy).

🦟 I'm currently working on transposable elements in mosquitoes to learn more about their potential role in the thermal adaptability of these creatures. To do so, I combine wet lab experiments and downstream bioinformatics analysis. My other research interests include eco-evo-devo, population genetics and evolutionary biology.
